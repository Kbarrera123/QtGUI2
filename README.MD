# StudBudget

StudBudget is a student budgeting app that helps you track your expenses and save money. It features personalized financial advice and data visualization like pie charts and line graphs. It has specialized categories such as "Tuition" and "Rent" that are perfect for a college student. It is a standalone C++ application with an integrated GUI built in Qt.

StudBudget was created by a group of 7 UF Computer Science and Engineering students for a class project.

## Getting Started

In order to build this app, we had a team of 7 that was split into several main areas (see _Authors_ below for who did what):

* Backend -- Calculations
* Frontend -- Qt GUI
* Data Visualization -- Using QtCharts
* Integration -- Combining the frontend and backend

### Prerequisites

Coding StudBudget required prior knowledge of C++, but some things we were able to learn along the way included:

* GitHub
* Qt
  * QtCreator
  * QtCharts
  * QtDesigner
* Databases (using a .txt file(s))
* User Authentication / Login system
* Encryption, Security, Hashing

### Installing

You will need to clone this GitHub repository (or make your own if you're starting from scratch), and download Qt.

We used the commercial trial of Qt, which only lasts for a short period of time, but you may be able to extend it if you contact the company. The Qt installation may take some time.

## Testing and Debugging

With so much code and so many different calculations and expense types, we ran into several bugs while using the app that were difficult to find in the code.

Be sure to use proper naming conventions and keep names consistent throughout the program!

It is important to check that each of the months and different features are working properly by inputting different data and catching edge cases.

## Deployment

Deployment was difficult using Qt. We were able to deploy the app for Windows by creating a standalone .exe file, but deploying for Mac proved to be more difficult.

It may be easier to start off using Qt Open Source, as it allows you to deploy the app more easily, it is free, and your access to it will not suddenly end like the commercial trial.
